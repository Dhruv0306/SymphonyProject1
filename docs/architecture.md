The system is organized into several layers:
- **Client Layer**: Web interface and CLI clients
- **Application Layer**: Request handling, authentication, and processing
- **Model Layer**: YOLO model management and inference
- **Storage Layer**: File and cache management
- **Monitoring**: System metrics and visualization

## Detailed Processing Pipeline

This diagram shows the step-by-step flow of image processing and logo detection.

Key processing stages:
1. Image submission and validation
2. Authentication and request processing
3. Image enhancement and normalization
4. Model selection and inference
5. Result aggregation and response
6. CSV export functionality for batch results

## Data Flow and Storage

This diagram illustrates how data moves through the system and is stored.
